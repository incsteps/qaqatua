# Projects

You can create up to 3 projects, identified by a "name"

Every project contains a priv/public key pair and a field list so you can create complex pipelines
encrypting and decrypting across different services using different keys/fields 

To specify which project to use in the operation set the `project` query string value with the name of your
preference. In case you don't specify any, QaQatua will use the first in the database
