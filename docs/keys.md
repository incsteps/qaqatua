# Keys

To encrypt/decrypt payloads, Qaqatua needs a private/public keys.

**Don't use production keys with Qaqatua**

These keys can be provided (and stored in the database) to Qaqatua and they will be associated to a project,
so when you are sending payloads to encrypt or decrypt, Qaqatua will use them in runtime.

In case you don't have a pair of keys you can request to Qaqatua to generate them for you. Current version will
generate RSA keys

If you have the priv/pub keys you can upload them when you're creating the project  

**Don't use production keys with Qaqatua**
