# Welcome

This is the documentation for the project QaQatua, an encrypt/decrypt site of payloads.

The aim of this site is to help you to encrypt and decrypt your payloads in a simple way.

QaQatua is useful for QA's who needs to deal with microservices where some parts of the payloads need to be encrypted before to send.
